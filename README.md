This is a GPU implementation of fractional differencing (we call it GFD). It allows rapid large-scale implementation of fractional differencing to minimize memory loss while achieving stationary for time series data.

## Experiment Our Code Instantly Now on Google Colaboratory

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ritchieng/fractional_differencing_gpu/blob/master/notebooks/gpu_fractional_differencing.ipynb)

Easily run the whole tutorial in a self-contained Jupyter Notebook on Google Colaboratory by pressing the button above. The whole process of including pulling all data, dependencies and running the code for GFD is contained in the notebook, allowing you to run this notebook as is.

## Summary Results
Number of data points and time taken in seconds. You can easily reach such similar multipliers on Google Colab or on more powerful machines via GCP, AWS or your local servers/machines.

## Optimized Version by NVIDIA
Full credits to NVIDIA where they built on our work and further speed things up resulting in almost 10000x speed-up over a CPU implementation. You can find the more complex and less intuitive but highly performance version of GFD by NVIDIA in this [notebook](https://github.com/ritchieng/fractional_differencing_gpu/blob/master/notebooks/nvidia_gpu_fractional_differencing.ipynb).

## Simple GFD Function

We've created a simple function in the notebook, pass your Pandas dataframe into the function and it will return fractionally differenced time series dataframe.

### Arguments
- `d`: fractional differencing value, 0 means no differencing, above 1 means integer differencing, and anything between 0 to 1 is fractional differencing.
- `floor`: minimum value to ignore for fixed window fractional differencing.
    
### Notes
- Your dataframe (`df_raw`) is required to have an index such that it's from lag k (oldest time) to lag 0 (latest time) from top to the bottom of the dataframe accordingly for this function to work appropriately.
    - Future: We will implement auto-fixes moving forward such that you don't have to care about the order of your dataframe, but just take in the mean time.
- We tested for dataframes up to 100 million data points per function call (per dataframe essentially).

### GPU implementation

```python
gfd, weights = frac_diff_gpu(df_raw, d=0.5, floor=5e-5)
```

### CPU implementation

```python
fd, weights = frac_diff(df_raw, d=0.5, floor=5e-5)
```

## GFD Repository Plans
- Make GFD more efficient
    - Chunk size implementation: currently just throwing the entire chunk matching the size of the dataset's length (haha).
- Run GFD on thousands of time series datasets, creating a grid of t-stats and time benchmarks.
- Package GFD functions into a pip package for quick running

## Release Notes
The next release will include multiple 1D blocks in a 1D grid instead of a single 1D block of 518/1024 threads. This will help users understand multiple blocks vs a single block.

Beyond the next release, we'll be moving to explain the use of more than 1 dimension blocks/grids.
